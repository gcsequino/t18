## Review

### Epics completed  
We completed the Shorter Trip epic, load trip and Save trip, as well as the first iteration of User Experience.

### Epics not completed 
All planned epics were completed

## Retrospective
After gaining a team member, another one withdrew from the class leaving us as a team of four again. We were able to plan around the rest of the sprint accordingly, and finish all planned epics on time

### Things that went well
Our plan was the most robust one yet, and we were keeping each other updated on what tasks we were doing

### Things we need to improve
We could still work on communicating a little better when we are stuck on a problem, and reaching out to teammates for help

### One thing we will change next time
More communication on help needed for a given task
