## Review
Sprint did not go as well as planned due to our lack of detail on our planning.

### Epics completed  
Where Am I?

### Epics not completed 
Find, Interoperability

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
Our sprint had more scrum meetings which helped our team understand what every member was doing and collaboration. We also understood the architecture of our clients and server better. 

### Things we need to improve
We need to start our issues earlier, so we do not have a time crunch before the deadline and break tasks and epics into more details. We also need to plan our sprint in more detail to make sure we have a successful sprint. If we have an issue, we need to reach out to our teamates for help earlier.

### One thing we will change next time
Plan sprints better and create more granular tasks
