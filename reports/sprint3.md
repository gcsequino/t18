* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
In Sprint 3 we are planning on completing Find Places, Interoperability, Distances, Load Trip, Save Trip, and Trip Name. Find Places and Interoperability were not finished in Sprint 2, so they will be finished with the highest priority in Sprint 3.
