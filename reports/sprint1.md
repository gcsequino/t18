## Planned Epics

We plan on doing the Team Identification and About epics. Tasks for the Team Identification epic include issue #12 "Set the team number and name on the server", #13 "Set the team number and name on the client", and #14 "Set the team number and name on the browser tab". These task all involve modifying the boiler plate code that will be provided to us. Tasks for the About epic include issue #28 "Update design for addition of team and member information", #39 "Create/add new components to support the stucture", #31 "Write a team mission statement", and #33-37 "Add ?'s image, name, and short bio".

## Metrics

These metrics reflect what was planned at the beginning of the sprint and what we actually completed by the end of the sprint.

## Review

A solid first sprint. We were able to finish both epics as well as every task underneath them. We met about once a week outside of class to discuss and review what our plan was for the week, as well as helping each other get comfortable using github and setting up remote development.

#### Epics completed  

We completed both the Team Identification and About epics, which show our team's number and name, as well as our individual bios and personal information.

#### Epics not completed 

There are no epics left to complete for this sprint.


## Retrospective

#### Things that went well

We were able to communicate well with each other on what we were working on, and together we were on the same page as a team as to what had to be completed and in what order to do it.

#### Things that we need to improve

We should make more time to have daily scrums outside of class if we are not given the chance during the class time. Due to time constraints, we cannot stay after class ends to have a daily scrum, so we will have to figure out a way to organize a scrum schedule or meeting time to discuss.

#### One thing we will change next time

As a team, we will work harder to complete the tasks farther from the deadline as it gives us more breathing room if there are technical difficulties or if something doesn't deploy properly. The closer we are to the deadline, the worse off we are if something goes wrong.
