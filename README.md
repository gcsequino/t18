Our team's mission is to create a stable product while working efficiently in a team setting. We are planning on meeting in person once a week (time TBD) to discuss the current sprint and planning on how we could improve our workflow. Our focus is outputting quality work free of issues in a timely manner.

If a team issue arrises, we will resolve it in person so there is no miscommunication and internal conflict. When planning the sprint, we will distrubute the work evenly accoridng to the skill sets of the team members and the work and impact of the issue.

If a team member misses a deadline during the sprint, the team will converse and understand why it was missed and move it into the next sprint to be finished with a higher priority.
