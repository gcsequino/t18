# Preferences for Billy Ginna

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail, or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text works best, any time from 9-4, otherwise I might be at work and not able to answer right away
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I am hoping to work together with my team to create a stable and useful product. I don't expect us to 100% complete every single task, but I'm hoping to get close to it
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'm hoping to become better at asking for help from my teammates to help me complete a task more quickly
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Sometimes other teammates have different goals in mind, so we will have to discuss and possibly meet in the middle
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I'm sure we can have a team discussion on what our options are, and find a middle ground. Obviously an A will benefit the whole team much better than a B would, so that might be a factor
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Absolutely, although I'm hoping the team will strive to all get A's. This class will be easier if everyone tries their best
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm not sure what exactly we are doing yet, so I will wait until after the first sprint to make a judgment
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We can talk about it as a team, and use our strengths to assign the work in the most efficient way
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We can talk with them about why they didn't finish, and if it continues we can talk to Dave
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If the work accomplishes the goal and is clean code, its up to the rest of the team if we should improve it any more
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We can make a flexible schedule and be flexible with assignments as other classes can get in the way
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We can set one up, it doesnt have to be in person rather a time when we are all working on the project together
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Probably a few times a week
1. __Will you need the approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * For major decisions and changes, its a good idea to at least notify everyone that you are doing something
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We can discuss why they dont agree with something, and look into other possible options
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We can discuss why we feel that way, and look into making sure no one oversteps their bounds
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I can ask my teammates to pick up a little extra work, and if that doesnt work I can consult dave
