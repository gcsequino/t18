# Preferences for Jeydn Byrd

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, at any hour of the day. You can email also, but I won't respond as quickly. My number is 720-985-1489
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect to thoroughly finish our project on time.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to learn how to form a good team out of people I haven't met before.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * One obstacle I'm worried about this semester is the team not having good communication and falling behind because of it. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Aim for an A-/B+
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If they want to, as long as everybody else gets to do enough work also.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I'm not sure, we'll have to see more about what the project is going to look like.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I'm also not sure on this one yet, again we'll have to know more about the project/activities.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If it happens once or twice, we'll just have to work harder to make up for it. If it happens consistently we'll need to talk to whoever isn't finishing their part
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We'll have to come together and agree on a quality standard 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Find out which work habits apply best to different parts of the project 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, it'd be good to have in person meetings outside of class
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week at least
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Ideally, yes
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * In the case of one person disagreeing, I think majority rule applies. If 2 people disagree with the remaining 3 I think a re-evaluation needs to happen
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Bring others into the process
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'd distribute them more evenly
